#Archives

I currently work as _Assistant Director and Head of Digital Programs_ at [Rockefeller Archive Center](http://rockarch.org) in Tarrytown, NY.

My work focuses on using human-centered design principles to improve the user experience across all archival functions. I leverage technology to improve access to archival materials in ways that maximize values of openness, anonymity and transparency. 

You can read about some of the things I've done in the past few years on the Digital Program's blog, [Bits & Bytes](http://blog.rockarch.org/?author_name=harnold), and if you're interested in checking out some of the code I've written, you can find that on my [Github account](https://github.com/helrond).
