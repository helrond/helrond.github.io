# Music

I sing and play guitar, banjo and bass, and possibly other things with strings. I write my own songs, and you can see the lyrics of most of them (including those in progress) at [songs.hillelarnold.com](http://songs.hillelarnold.com "songs.hillelarnold.com").

## The Mermaids
A rock and roll band I started with my friend Josh. We both play guitar, sing, and write songs. We have put out two full-length albums and an EP, and sometimes play shows in NYC, Boston and Washington, DC.
