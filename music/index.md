#Music

I sing and play guitar, banjo and bass, and possibly other things with strings. I write my own songs, and you can see the lyrics of most of them [here](http://songs.hillelarnold.com "songs.hillelarnold.com").

##Bands

[The Mermaids](http://the-mermaids.com) is a rock and roll band I started with my friend Josh. We both play guitar, sing, and write songs. We have put out two full-length albums and an EP, and sometimes play shows in NYC, Boston and Washington, DC.

[The Curb](http://thecurbmusic.com) is a country-punk band I'm in with my brother Chris. He plays drums and sings backup, I play guitar and sing lead vocals. We have one full-length album out.

[Rams Head Lady Slipper](http://www.ramsheadladyslipper.com/) is an indie-pop band I play acoustic guitar and sing backups with occasionally.
