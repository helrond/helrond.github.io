When the big shots
become bigger shots
then the little shots
become littler shots.

And when the little shots
become littler shots
because the big shots
become bigger shots
then the little shots
get mad at the big shots.

And when the little shots
get mad at the big shots
because the big shots
by becomming bigger shots
make the little shots
littler shots
they shoot the big shots
full of little shots.

But by shooting the big shots
full of little shots
the little shots
do not become big shots,
they make everything all shot.
