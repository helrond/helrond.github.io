God wants us 
to be our brother's keeper.

To feed the hungry,
to clothe the naked,
to shelter the homeless,
to instruct the ignorant,
at a personal sacrifice,
is what God
wants us to do.

What we give to the poor
for Christ's sake
is what we carry with us
when we die.

As [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau) say:
"When man dies
he carries
in his clutches hands
only that which
he has given away."
