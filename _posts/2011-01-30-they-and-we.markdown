People say:
"They don't do this,
they don't do that,
they ought to do this,
this ought to do that."

Always "They"
and never "I".

People should say:
"They are crazy
for doing this
and not doing that
but I don't need
to be crazy
the way they are crazy."

The Communitarian Revolution
is basically
a personal revolution.

It starts with I
not with They.

One I plus one I
makes two I
and two I makes We.

"We" is a community
while "they" is a crowd.
