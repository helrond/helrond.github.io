John McCain, if the last eight years have taught us anything, it is that it is NOT at all difficult to convince Americans that something they know is false is actually true.

Telling us we're smarter than we actually are is condescending, wrong, and downright evil.  No number of Daily Show appearances will convince me otherwise.
