title: Teachers Of Subjects

Out business managers
don't know how to manage
the things they try to manage,
because they don't understand
the things they try to manage.

So they turn to college professors
in the hope of understanding
the things they try to manage.

But college professors
do not profess anything,
they only teach subjects.

As teachers of subjects,
college professors
may enable people
to master subjects,
but mastering subjects
has never enabled anyone
to master situations.
