Seems appropriate on today, the most patriotic of all days, to tell you that I'm really, really digging [Apostle of Hustle's](http://www.myspace.com/apostleofhustle) record [_National Anthem of Nowhere_](http://www.arts-crafts.ca/apostleofhustle/index2.html). I've just run through it once, and it was so good I'm doing what I rarely do, which is immediately listen to it again.

Y'all do the same.
