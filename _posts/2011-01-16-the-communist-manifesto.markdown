Having realized
that a [Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto)
was the basis of a Communist Movement,
Karl Marx decided
to write a Communist Manifesto.

To write the Communist Manifesto
Karl marx did not use
his own analysis of Capitalism.

He took the criticism
of the bourgeois society of his time
by [Victor Considerant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Prosper_Considerant)
and made it the first part
of the Communist Manifesto.

He took the definition of Communism
by [Proudhon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon)
and made it his own.

He tried to make himself believe
that class struggle was the first step
from a Capitalist society
where man is inhuman to man
to a Communist society
where man in human to man.
