Because [John Calvin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin)
legalized money-lending at interest,
the State has legalized
money-lending at interest.

Because the State has legalized
money-lending at interest,
home owners
have mortgaged their farms;
institutions
have mortgaged their buildings;
congregations
have mortgaged their churches;
cities, counties, States
and Federal Government
have mortgaged their budgets.

So people find themselves
in all kinds of financial difficulties
because the State
has legalized money-lending at interest
in spite of the teachings
of the Prophets of Israel
and the [Fathers of the Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Fathers).
