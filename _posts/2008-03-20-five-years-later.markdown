Yesterday was the five-year anniversary of the war in Iraq - although let's face it, it's been going on for far longer than that - and there were [a ton](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/us/20protest.html) of protests [all over](http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/node/31950) the place.  More than a few of my friends [ended up](http://www.pieandcoffee.org/2008/03/19/5-arrested-for-praying-the-rosary-in-worcester/) in handcuffs.<!-- more -->

Meanwhile, Bush continues to [defend the war](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/world/middleeast/20prexy.html?_r=1&scp=2&sq=iraq&st=nyt&oref=slogin) and McCain seems to have [no grasp](http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/washington/politics-usa-politics-mccain-britain.html?scp=8&sq=iraq&st=nyt) on the situation at all.

I had been meaning to work myself up into a little more of a righteous frenzy, but I'm sick today and realize that everything has already [been said](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/02/03/opinion/04opart.html) far more [eloquently](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Obama-Iraq.html?scp=1&sq=iraq+obama&st=nyt) than I can ever hope to say it.  Let's just stop, okay?  This is beyond ridiculous.
