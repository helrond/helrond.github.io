In seventeenth-century France
there was a priest
by the name of Vincent.

Father Vincent realized
that the country
was going to the dogs.

When something goes wrong
they say in France:
"[Cherchez la femme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchez_la_femme)-
look for the woman."

Looking for the woman
Father Vincent found out
that many woman
were trying to be
the mistresses of the rich.

[St. Vincent of Paul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul)
gathered several women
and told them:
"If you want
to put the country on its feet
refuse to be
the mistress of the rich
and choose to be
the servants of the poor."
