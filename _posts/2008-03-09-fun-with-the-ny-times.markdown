from an [Alex Balk post](http://alexbalk.tumblr.com/post/27605882): "Either the _Times_ thinks its audience is full of effete retards or I am just, finally, really _old_."

Don't worry, Mr. Balk.  You're not old, at least not yet, based on the evidence provided in [this comment](http://community.nytimes.com/article/comments/2008/02/08/arts/music/08plea.html) to an article titled "[Not Highfalutin, but Highly Satisfying Indulgences](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/arts/music/08plea.html):"<!-- more -->

Then, purists be damned (and you all know who you are...), there's the Sitkovetsky transcription of the Goldberg Variations, on Nonesuch. And in a similar vein, there's Lenny's politically incorrect VPO recordings of two late Beethoven quarters, Opp. 131 and 135. And will someone please give us a modern recording of Felix Weingartner's transcription of the Hammerklavier Sonata? I can't get enough of recordings of the "Last Night of the Proms."
