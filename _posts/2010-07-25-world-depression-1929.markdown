After the World War
people tried to believe
that a New Era
had dawned upon the world.

People thought
that they had found a solution
to the problem
of mass-distribution.

People thought
that the time had come
for the two-car garage,
a chicken in every pot,
and a sign "To Let"
in front of every poor-house.

And everybody
wanted to cash in
on the future prosperity.

So stock promoters got busy
and stocked people with stocks
till they got stuck.
