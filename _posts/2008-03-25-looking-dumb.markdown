So a while back I posted about MSN's "No One Wants to Look Dumb" ad campaign, which involved a ridiculous Woody Guthrie reference and a fair amount of, well, looking dumb.

Seems I was, ahem, ahead of the curve for once. I know we are all shocked. [AdFreak](http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2008/03/msn-anti-dumb-e.html) just posted a slightly uncharitable review of said campaign. Apparently MSN went to the trouble to put up a dedicated [website](http://www.noonewantstolookdumb.com/) for their, um, less than brilliant idea.

Needless to say, I feel extremely hip. This will last until I get on the elevator at Bobst library with 20 NYU undergrads, at which point I will just feel old.

I need something strong to wash this irony down.
