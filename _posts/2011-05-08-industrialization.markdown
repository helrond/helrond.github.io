Lenin said:
"The world cannot be
half industrial
and half agricultural."

England, Germany,
Japan, and America
have become
industrialized.

Soviet Russia
is trying to keep up
with England, Germany,
Japan, and America.

When all the world
becomes industrialized
every country
will be looking
for foreign markets.

But when every country
becomes industrialized
you will not have
foreign markets.
