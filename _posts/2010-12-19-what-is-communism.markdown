Communists believe
in capturing the State
so as to be able
to use it as a club
to prevent anybody
from becoming a [Capitalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism).

The Communist manifesto
defines [Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_communism)
as "a state of society"
where each one works
according to his ability
and gets
according to his needs."

Using the power of the State
will enable Communists
to prevent anybody
from becoming
a successful Capitalist
but it will not
make anybody
Communist at heart.

To be a Communist
according to the definition
of the [Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto)
is to be willing to give one's labor
for the benefit
of a Communist Community.
