Professors of a Farming Commune
do not look for endowments;
they look for manual labor.

Professors of a Farming Commune
do not tell their students
what to do;
they show them
how to do it.

Professors of a Farming Commune
do not enable their students
to master subjects;
they enable them
to master situations.

Professors of a Farming Commune
do not teach their students
how to make
profitable deals;
they teach them
how to realize
worthy ideals.
