The aim of the Communists
is to take over the control
of the [means of production](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production)
and distribution.

The means of production
and distribution
are now in the hands
of Capitalists.

The class war is a war
between Communists
and Capitalists
over control
of the means of production
and distribution.

Patriots believe
that the way to bring about
a [classless society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_society)
is a class war
between the [Capitalist State](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)
and the [working class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class).
