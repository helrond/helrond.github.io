The Prophets of Israel
and the Fathers of the Church
forbade lending money at interest.

Lending at interest
was called usury
by the Prophets of Israel
and the Fathers of the Church.

Usurers were not considered
to be gentlemen
when people used to listen
to the Prophets of Israel
and the Fathers of the Church.

When people used to listen
to the Prophets of Israel
and the Fathers of the Church
they could not see anything gentle
in trying to live
on the sweat of somebody else's brow
by lending money at interest.
