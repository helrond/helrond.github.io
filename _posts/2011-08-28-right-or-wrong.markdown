Some people say:
"My country
is always right."

Some people say:
"My country
is always wrong."

Some people say:
"My country
is sometimes right
and sometimes wrong,
but my country
right or wrong."

To stick up for one's country 
when one's country is wrong
does not make 
the country right.

To stick up for the right
even when the world is wrong
is the only way we know
to make everything right.
