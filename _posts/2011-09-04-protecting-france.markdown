To protect French citizens
living in Algeria
the French took Algeria
from the natives.

To protect Algeria
the French took control
for Tunisia.

To protect Senegal
the French took Dahomey,
the Gabon, and the Congo.

To protect the isle of Reunion
the French took Madagascar.

They took Madagascar
for another reason.

The other reason was
that the English
wished to take it.

When the English
take something
the French say:
"The English do that
because they are grabbers."

When the French take something,
the French say:
"We do that
because we are
good patriots."
