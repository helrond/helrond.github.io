[Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) soon realized
that his own analysis
of [bourgeois society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie)
could not be the basis
of a dynamic [revolutionary movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_movement).

Karl Marx soon realized
that a forceful [Communist Manifesto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Communist_Manifesto)
was the necessary foundation
of a dynamic [Communist Movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern).

Karl Marx soon realized,
as [Lenin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin) realized,
that there is no [revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution)
without revolutionary action;
that there is no revolutionary action
without a revolutionary movement;
that there is no revolutionary movement
without a vanguard of revolution
and that there is no vanguard of revolution
without a theory of revolution.
