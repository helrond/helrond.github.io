And when the capitalists
or accumulators of labor
have accumulated so much
of the laborer's labor
that they no longer
find it profitable
to buy the labor's labor
then the laborers
can no longer
sell their labor
to the capitalists
or accumulators of labor.

And when the laborers
can no longer
sell their labor
to the capitalists
or accumulators of labor,
they can no longer buy
the products of their labor.

And that is
what the laborers get
for selling their labor
to the capitalists
or accumulators of labor.
