title: Interactive Social Contract
---

So I was out in San Francisco for a week over the holidays (basically I was acting as posse/moral support for Miss SlightlyRidiculous who was presenting her genius at MLA) and while walking around in the [Mission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_District,_San_Francisco,_California) (love it, btw) managed to find [Clarion Alley](http://www.inn-california.com/sanfrancisco/SanFrancisco/Mission/clarion.html), home to an amazingly diverse group of [murals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_Alley_Mural_Project). Photos, in case you haven't seen them, are [here](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=logo#/album.php?aid=2098736&id=26310410).

Anyway, [one of the photos](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=33025933&id=26310410) I took was of this mural for something called "The Interactive Social Contract." Looking at the photo later, I realized there was a [website](http://vototron.com/). And it's amazing. So go look at it. Now.
