As one of my co-workers put it, "Lou Reed is like a cartoon to me."  I hate to say it, but I agree...


> "People say, "ËœHow would you know that?'" Reed said, after Willner asked him to recite some verses of his poignant "Rock Minuet."  "You're joking right? I have a BA in dope. But a PhD in soul."

Seriously, Lou? If you have to tell me you have an advanced degree in soul, well...you don't (entire article [here](http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/sxsw-lou-reed-1.html)).

Also came across this apt description in, of all places, [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/riff_blog/archives/2008/03/7655_lou-reed-punk-sxsw.html):


> Lou Reed reminds me a little bit of my grandmother. He's old, he's got bad posture and a New York accent, and he's a little pessimistic. But if you stick around long enough, he'll offer up some keen insight and make you laugh.


Nice.
