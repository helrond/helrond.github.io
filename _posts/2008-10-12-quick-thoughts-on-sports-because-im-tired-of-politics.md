title: Quick thoughts on sports (because I'm tired of politics)
---

1. I am totally psyched for Manny v. Boston in the World Series.

2. John Madden is one of the stupidest people on television.

3. Troy Aikman, and I quote, "he continually continues to take bad angles on plays." Dude, you embarrassed yourself enough as a quarterback.

4. I don't know about you, but I can't wait for the inevitable TO implosion, which should come next week. Here's hoping he bitchslaps Tony Romo while screaming, "take that, Jessica."

5. Seriously, is any of this stupider than [this](http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/10/who_wrote_dreams_from_my_fathe_1.html)?
