In 1200 A.D.
there was no Capitalist System,
there was the Guild System.

The doctrine of the Guilds
was the doctrine
of the Common Good.

The people used to say
as they do now:
"What can I do for you?"
but they meant what they said.
  
Now they say one thing
and they mean another.

They did not look for markets,
they let markets
look for them.
