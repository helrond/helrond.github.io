title: Why Not Be A Beggar?
categories:

People who are in need
and are not afraid to beg
give to people not in need
the occasion to do good
for goodness' sake.

Modern society
calls the beggar
bum and panhandler
and gives him the bum's rush.

The [Greeks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks) used to say
that people in need
are the ambassadors of the gods.

We read in the Gospel:
"As long as you did it
to one of the least
of My brothers
you did it to Me."

While modern society
calls the beggars
bums and [panhandlers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging),
they are in fact
the Ambassadors of God.

To be God's Ambassador
is something 
to be proud of.
