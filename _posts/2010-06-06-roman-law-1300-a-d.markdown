In 1300 A.D.
the Roman Law
took place
of the Canon Law.

The Roman Law
enables rich men
to live among the poor men.

The Canon Law
enables good men
to live among bad men.

"Divide to rule"
became the slogan
of the politicians.

In his book "The Prince",
Machiavelli
taught them how.

So politics
ceased to be policy
and became 
just politics.
