The Laissez-Faire Economists
told everybody
that competition
is the life of trade
and that it is a case
of survival of the fittest.

So since 1800
looking for markets
has engaged men's activities.

And since trade follows the flag
industral nations
have also become
imperialst nations.

The fight for markets
between two industrial nations,
England and Germany,
was the main cause 
of the World War.
