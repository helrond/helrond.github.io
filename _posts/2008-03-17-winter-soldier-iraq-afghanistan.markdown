Just when you thought we were getting over [this](http://www.forusa.org/programs/iraq/img/abughraib.jpg), along comes [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO7xwnZA124)...

[Iraq Veterans Against the War](http://ivaw.org/) organized the event "Winter Soldier: Iraq & Afghanistan," (a reference to the [Vietnam-era film](http://www.wintersoldierfilm.com/) which never saw theatrical or television release) which aired some of these stories. The Underwire had [a cute story](http://blog.wired.com/underwire/2008/03/us-soldiers-bri.html) on how technology is helping soldiers to release accounts of atrocities more easily, which is true, but also does make you wonder what is not seeing the light of day.<!-- more -->

Not that any of this really is a surprise; I mean, we're not losing the war in Iraq because we're such good humanitarians.  It is, however, seriously discouraging, and I think we could all use a little more positive news these days...or maybe it's just me.
