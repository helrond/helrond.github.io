People who are in need
are not invited
to spend the night
in homes of the rich.

here are guest rooms
in the homes of the rich
but they are not 
for those who need them.

They are not
for those who need them
because those who need them
are no longer considered
as the Ambassadors of God.

So the duty of hospitality
is no longer considered
as a personal duty.

So people without a home
are sent to the city
where hospitality is given
at the taxpayer's expense.
