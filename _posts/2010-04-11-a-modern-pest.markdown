"What ails modern society
is separation
of the spiritual
from the material",
says Glenn Frank.

"Secularism is a pest",
says Pius XI.

When religion
has nothing to do
with education,
education,
education is only
information;
plenty of facts,
but no understanding.

When religion
has nothing to do
with politics,
politics is only
factionalism:
"Let's turn the rascals out
so our good friends
can get in."
When religion
has nothing to do
with business,
business is only
commercialism:
"Let's get what we can
while the getting is good."
