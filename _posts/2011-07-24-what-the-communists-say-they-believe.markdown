that the capitalist system
has reached the point
where it no longer works.

Communists believe
that when the workers
come to the realization
of the downfall of capitalism
they will no longer tolerate it.

Communists believe
that the capitalist class
will resort to all means
that may be in their power
to maintain their existence.

Communists believe
that the Communist Party
knows how to assure
production and distribution
in an orderly manner
according to a pre-designed plan.
