Before John Calvin
people were not allowed
to lend money at interest.

John Calvin decided
to legalize
money-lending at interest
in spite of the teachings
of the Prophets of Israel
and the Fathers of the Church.

Protestant countries
tried to keep up with John Calvin
and money-lending at interest
became the general practice.

And money ceased to be
a means of exchange
and began to be
a means to make money.

So people lent money on time
and started to think of time
in terms of money
and said to each other:
"Time is money."
