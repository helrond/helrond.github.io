A politician is an artist
in the art of following the wind
of  public opinion.

He who follows the wind
of public opinion
does not follow
his own judgement.

And he who does not follow
his own judgement
cannot lead people
out of the beaten path.

He is like the tail of a dog
that tries to lead the head.

When people stand behind their president
and their president
stands behind them
they and their president
go around in a circle
getting nowhere.
