Before he died
Karl Marx told one of his friends:
"I have lived long enough
to be able to say
that i am not a [Marxist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism)."

To be a Marxist,
according to the logic of [Das Kapital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital),
is to maintain
that the best thing to do
is to wait patiently
till Capitalism
has fulfilled its historic mission.

To be a Marxist
according to the logic of Das Kapital,
is to step back,
take and academic view of things,
and watch the self-satisfied [Capitalists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)
dig their own graves.

To be a Marxist,
according to the logic of Das Kapital,
is to let economic evolution
do its work
without ever attempting
to give it a push.
