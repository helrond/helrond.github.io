To protect the British Isles
the English took the sea.

To protect the sea
the English took Gibraltar,
Canada, and India.

To protect India
the English went to Egypt.

To protect Egypt
the English took the Sudan.

To protect the Sudan
the English forced the French
to leave Fashoda.

To protect the Cape and Natal
the English took the Transvaal.

To protect South Africa
the English prevented the French
from giving Agadir
to Germany.

So the English
are just as good
or just as bad 
as the French.
