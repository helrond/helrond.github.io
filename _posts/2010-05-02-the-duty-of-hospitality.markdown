title: The Duty of Hospitality
categories:

People who are in need 
and are not afraid to beg 
give to people not in need 
the occasion to do good 
for goodness'sake.

Modern society calls the beggar 
bum and panhandler 
and gives him the bum's rush. 
But the Greeks used to say 
that people in need
are the ambassadors of the gods.

Although you may be called 
bums and panhandlers 
you are in fact
the Ambassadors of God.

As God's Ambassadors 
you should be given food, 
clothing and shelter 
by those who are able to give it.

Mahometan teachers tell us 
that God commands hospitality, 
and hospitality is still practiced 
in Mahometan countries.

But the duty of hospitality 
is neither taught nor practiced 
in Christian countries.
