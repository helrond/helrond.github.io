So a few weekends ago I finally got around to watching the latest Indiana Jones movie. My review? Well, it was an Indiana Jones movie, which meant that I was thoroughly entertained, if only because the movie perfectly met my expectations (obscure and probably erroneous archaeological references, bad people with Russian accents, and wholesale destruction of newly discovered cultural landmarks).<!-- more -->

The alien presence which drives the (admittedly thin) plot reminded me of one of the more bizarre pronouncements to come out of the Vatican recently. In case you haven't heard about this yet, Father Gabriel Funes, director of the Vatican Observatory, released a statement titled "Aliens Are My Brother" in which he says that, according to the Catholic Church, aliens could in fact exist. Also, they would be [free from original sin](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7399661.stm). Insert your own joke here.

The Vatican is apparently not the only governmental body to lately take an interest in aliens and monsters. As pointed out to me by Nick, Japan's Defense Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, is apparently [concerned](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/world/asia/22japan-briefs.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin) about his country's ability to respond to an attack by Godzilla, thanks to their pacifist Constitution. I guess everything has its price.

So there you have it; an extremely random Tuesday afternoon post.
