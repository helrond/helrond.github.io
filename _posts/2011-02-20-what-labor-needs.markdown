A Communist Community
is a Community
with a common unity.

A common belief
is what makes the unity
if a community.

[Norman Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Thomas) says

has failed to give to Labor
a philosophy of labor".

What labor needs
is not [economic security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_security).

What Labor needs
is a philosophy of labor.
