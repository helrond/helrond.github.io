Some say
that inflation is desirable.
  
Some say
that inflation is deplorable.

Some say
that inflation is deplorable
but inevitable.

The way to avoid inflation
is to tighten the burden
of money-borrowers
without robbing the money-lenders.

And the way
to lighten the burden
of money-borrowers
with robbing the money-lenders
is to pass two laws:
one law making immediately illegal
all interest on money lent
and another law
obligating the money-borrowers
to pay one per cent of the debt
every year
during a period
of a hundred years.
