"Capital", says [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx),
"is accumulated labor,
not for the benefit of the laborers,
but for the benefit of the accumulators."

And Capitalists succeed
in accumulating labor
by treating labor
not as a gift,
but as a commodity,
buying it as any other commodity
at the lowest possible price.

And [organized labor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union)
plays into the hands
of the capitalists
or accumulators of labor
by treating their own labor
not as a gift,
but as a commodity,
selling it as any other commodity
at the highest possible price.
