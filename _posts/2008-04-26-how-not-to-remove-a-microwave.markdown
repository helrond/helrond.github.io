I am now teaching a course in how not to remove your over-the-range microwave oven.

I am also offering a class in how not to order a new microwave oven (a hint: it involves ordering from [Rainbow Appliance](http://www.rainbowappliance.com/), who will them promptly lose your order and will refuse to return multiple phone messages).

And by popular demand, I will be offering my world-famous class in how not to install a new over-the-range microwave oven soon, with special guest instructor Steve Borla.
