A couple of month ago, I guested on an episode of "Woody's Children" hosted by the irrepressible [Bob Sherman](http://www.wfuv.org/about/staff/sherman.html) with my good friends [Anne Price](http://members.aol.com/aeprice/index.html) and [Steve Suffet](http://suffet.home.att.net/). Although the show aired on January 20th, I just recently managed to get my hands on the audio (hey [WFUV](http://www.wfuv.org/), how about updating your website so it doesn't look so 80's-tastic.  And what's the point of having an "archive" if there's nothing in it?  Just askin').<!-- more -->

Listening to it now, most of all I am relieved that I don't sound as stupid as I felt (especially when I couldn't answer Bob's question about [John L. Lewis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L_Lewis), over which I am still kicking myself) and that any of the umpteen flubs I made apparently didn't translate themselves into discernible mistakes.  All in all, I think I acquitted myself quite well.

I'm posting the whole thing below, and since I'm still figuring out how to do this whole audio embedding thing, I'm going to leave it all as one track, and provide you with the song list below.

02:10: _Peace Call_ (Anne, Steve, me)

10:41: _Dance Around My Atom Fire_ (me)

19:15: _Why Do You Stand There in the Rain?_ (Steve)

22:30: _one of the most embarrassing moments of my life_ (yup, all me)

24:38: _That Good Old Union Feeling_ (Steve)

28:15: _Ticky Tock_ (Anne)

38:42: _Blood of the Lamb_ (me)

48:16: _66 Highway Blues_ (Steve)

50:20: _Come When I Call You_ (Anne)
