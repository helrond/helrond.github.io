Pope Pius IX and Cardinal Newman
consider liberalism,
whether it be
religious, philosophical, or economic,
the greatest error of the nineteenth century.

Modern liberalism
is the logical sequence
of the so-called age of Enlightenment-
the age of Voltaire, Rousseau, Thomas Paine-
sometimes called the Age of Reason
in opposition to the Age of Faith.

By sponsoring nationalism and capitalism
modern liberals
have given up the search for truth
and have become paid propagandists.

Modern liberals have ceased to appeal to reason,
and have chosen to appeal to prejudice.

So the Age of Reason
has become the age of Treason,
as Julien Benda points out
in his book entitled:
"The treason of the Intellectuals".
