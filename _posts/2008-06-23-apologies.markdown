...to all of you faithful readers (I know, all two of you) for my extended absence. I've been out of town the last week-plus, and now that I am back, find myself swamped with an overflowing inbox, blog reader, and to-do list. I'll be back soon. In the meantime, a few more words from Mr. Debs will have to do (and they always do so well).
