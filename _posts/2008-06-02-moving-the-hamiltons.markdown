Now _this _is something you won't see every day.

Walter pointed this out to me in the NY Times [City Room blog](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/packing-up-alexander-hamiltons-country-home/?scp=1-b&sq=hamilton+grange&st=nyt). If you'd seen where this house was before they moved it, you'd be even more impressed. There's a pretty decent [website ](http://www.nps.gov/hagr/parkmgmt/hamilton%2Dgrange%2Dnational%2Dmemorial%2Dmove%2Dupdates%2Ehtm#e_160913)(with pictures) courtesy of the National Park Service, who apparently have a shockingly good grasp of web technologies for a government agency.

The house is moving June 7th. I needs to get myself down there and see it. How often is it you see a house up on blocks in the middle of a New York City street?
