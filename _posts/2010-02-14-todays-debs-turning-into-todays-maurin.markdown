Next Sunday I'll be starting a new series of posts from the words of Peter Maurin,replacing "Today's Debs" as a weekly feature of this blog.Surely, Gentle Reader(s), you must be wondering who this Peter Maurin bloke is, and why he's taking over for the great [Gene Debs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Debs), and I'm here to tell you.<!-- more -->

Peter Maurin was the co-founder of the [Catholic Worker movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_worker). Very little biographical information is known about him (his [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Maurin) gives you a sense of just how slim the pickings are), in fact, very little is know about him at all, except that he dropped in at the home of friends where [Dorothy Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Day) was staying, started talking to her and didn't stop until she agreed to start a paper called the _Catholic Worker_ (he wanted to call it the _Catholic Radical_, she insisted on the "Worker" because of the resonance with the Communist Party's _[Daily Worker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Worker)_).

Maurin was a weird guy by all accounts, with questionable personal hygiene, the propensity to lecture at great length whether or not it was desired, and the habit of appearing or disappearing like a ninja. His lasting legacy (aside from the Catholic Worker movement) is a series of short poems he wrote called "Easy Essays." I'll be posting one of those a week.

The stye of Maurin's Easy Essays is pretty unique - basically a string of one-liners with little or no transition in between. Maurin thought they would be easily accessible to the "common man," but the truth is they're challenging to digest. Still, he comes up with some pretty good zingers that make it all worth it...
