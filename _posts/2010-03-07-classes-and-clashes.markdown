Business men say
that because everybody is selfish
business must necessarily
be based on selfishness.

But when business
is based on selfishness
everbody is busy
becoming more selfish.

And when everybody is busy
becoming more selfish,
you have classes and clashes.

Business men create problems;
they do not solve them.
