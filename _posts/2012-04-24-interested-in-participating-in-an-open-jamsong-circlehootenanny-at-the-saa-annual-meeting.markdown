title: Open jam/song circle/hootenanny at SAA 2012?

In conversations with a number of my more creative colleagues, we came up with idea to have some sort of an open jam session, song circle or hootenanny (or whatever else you want to call it) at this year's [SAA Annual Meeting](http://www2.archivists.org/conference/2012/san-diego?) in recognition of the fact that many of us [archivists are also musicians](http://terryx.wordpress.com/2012/02/10/what-i-learned-at-band-camp/). The admittedly vague plan, as it stands now, is that a group of interested folks would bring their voices and/or musical instruments to San Diego so we could get together and make some music. Although no date or time has been set, it would most likely be in some way attached to the all-attendee reception (which means there would be an audience). However, before I or anyone else spends a lot of time organizing something, I wanted to gauge the level of interest in this idea.<!-- more -->

So here's where I need your input. If you are interested in participating in such an event, able to bring whatever instrument you play to San Diego, and could bring a song or two to sing, please let me know, either by leaving a comment below or hitting me up on Twitter (@[helrond](http://twitter.com/#!/helrond)). Alternatively, if you think this is a dumb idea, can think of good reasons why it shouldn't happen, or have any other comments, please leave those too!
