A couple of shots from the 10th floor of Bobst Library, where shelving is being removed to make room for...more shelving. All in an effort to make some space for [TamWag](http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/tam/index.html). A sign of things to come?<!-- more -->

Of course, as someone pointed out to me today, given the whole "[exposing hidden collections](http://www.ala.org/ala/acrl/acrlpubs/crlnews/backissues2008/june08/hiddencollections.cfm)" jag that libraries are on these days, it seems weird that you can't jump directly to specific special collections from the NYU Library's [home page](http://library.nyu.edu/).

I'm sure there's a good reason for this, but I haven't figured out what it is yet.
