Carlyle says:
"He who has found his work
let him look
for no other blessedness."

But workmen
cannot find hapiness
in mechanized work.

As [Charles Devas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stanton_Devas) says,
"The great majority
having to perform
some mechanized operation
which requires little thought
and allows no originality
and which
concerns an object
in the transformation of which
whether previous or subsequent
they have no part,
cannot take pleasure
in their work."
