Fr. Henry Carr, Superior of the Basilians, says:
Socialists and Communists
battle against
the unequal conditions
of the poor.

Presumably they would be satisfied
if all were on a level.

Do you not see
that this does not touch
the question that is vital,
namely, whether or not the people,
no matter how much
or how little they possess,
regard it and use it
in the way they should?

The right way
is to regard it
as something entrusted to us
to use for the benefit
of ourselves and others.

The wrong way
is to look on it as something we own
and can use as we desire
without any duty to others.

Good or bad conditions
will follow
good or bad use
of property.
