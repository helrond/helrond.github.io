Just wanted to give a quick shout-out to all the people who have been wreaking havoc along the route of the Olympic torch. I'm impressed with the consistent pressure that's been brought to bear by people who live in different continents, speak different languages, and will probably never meet each other. Tibet is back in mainstream news again, and for a while it was even the top headline on ye olde ESPN.com. Nice work, y'all.<!-- more -->

China, meanwhile, has [condemned ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/07/ntorch507.xml)the "vile" protests. Yup, nothing like making your adversaries look reasonable by pulling out all the rhetorical stops.

The silence has been pretty deafening from our political leaders, although Hillary Clinton just called for a [partial Olympics boycott](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/04/07/clinton.olympics/). OK, Obama, you can one-up this, and I think [you know how](http://www.asianews.it/files/img/MYANMAR_-_Boicottaggio.jpg).

So much for apolitical posts.
