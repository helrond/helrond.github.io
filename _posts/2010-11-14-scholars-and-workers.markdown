By living with the workers
in Houses of Hospitality
scholars will be able
to convey to the workers
why things are
what they are,
how things would be
if they were as they should be,
and how a path can be made
from things as they are
to things as they should be.

By living with the workers
in Houses of Hospitality
scholars will be able
to win the workers' sympathy,
and therefore
keep the workers
from being influenced
by selfish demagogues.

By living with the workers
in Houses of Hospitality
scholars will be able
to become dynamic
and therefore
be the driving force
of a new social order.
