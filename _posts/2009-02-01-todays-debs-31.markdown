A few days ago one of the most prominent capitalist preachers in New York City issued a frenzied appeal from his pulpit for military preparedness. Thisparticular dog awakened just long enough to bark furiously at the command of his plutocratic master. He may not have received his 30 pieces of silver at the time; the reward of his apostasy comes in gold and flows into his capacious receptacle that connects with his master's bank vault all the year around. <!-- more -->Beware of capitalism's politicians and preachers! They are the lineal descendants of the hypocrites of old who all down the ages have guarded the flock in the name of patriotism and religion and secured the choicest provender and the snuggest booths for themselves by turning the sheep over to the ravages of the wolves.

Beware of the liveried hypocrites of the landlords, the usurers, the money-changers, the stock-gamblers,the exploiters, the enslavers and despoilers of the people; beware of the ruling class politicians and preachers and mercenary menials in every form who are so profoundly concerned about your "patriotism" and your "religion" and who receive their 30 pieces forewarning you against socialism because it will endanger your morality and interfere with your salvation.
