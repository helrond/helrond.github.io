There is nothing wrong
with [Communism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism),
but there is something wrong
with Communists.

The wrong thing with Communists is
that they are not Communists,
they are [Socialists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism).

There is no Communism
in [Soviet Russia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union),
there is [State Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism)
in Soviet Russia.

The State has not withered away,
the wage system still prevails,
and they are selling
7% [government bonds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_bond)
in Soviet Russia.

By selling 7% government bonds
they are creating
a new parasitic class
in Socialist Russia.
