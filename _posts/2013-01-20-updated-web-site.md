A couple of months ago, I decided it was time to redo my website. So, in an exercise to learn something new in the process, I've redone my site using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), a simple blogging framework built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Although you can use a number of services to power it, [Github](http://github.com) works really well (plus it's free). Since I'd already implemented a site for my song lyrics using [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), I wanted to dig into this service a little more. It also gave me the chance to dip my toes into the world of Ruby, which I hope to learn more about at this year's [Code4Lib conference](http://code4lib.org/conference/2013).

This was also my first time building a [responsive web site](http://matthew.reidsrow.com/articles/23). I won't argue that it's absolutely, totally, one hundred percent successful, but it was a good exercise in thinking differently about web development and usability.
