We read in the [Catholic Encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia)
that during the early ages
of Christianity
the Hospices
or [Houses of Hospitality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_hospitality)
was a shelter
for the sick, the poor,
the orphan, the old, the traveller,
and the needy of every kind.

Originally the Hospices
of Houses of Hospitality
were under the supervision
of the Bishops
who designated priests
to administer
the spiritual
and temporal affairs
of these charitable institutions.
