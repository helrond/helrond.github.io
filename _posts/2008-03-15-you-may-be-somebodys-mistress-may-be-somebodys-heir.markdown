So yesterday I was listening to _Blue on Brown_, the new record from the [Abrams Brothers](http://hillelarnold.com/blog/wp-admin/You%20may%20be%20somebody%27s%20mistress,%20may%20be%20somebody%27s%20heir), which is pretty cool.  You should check it out.  Anyway, they do a great cover of "Gotta Serve Somebody" on the record which had me cracking up.  I might have even laughed out loud on the subway (and you know what a faux pas that is).  Not only is the song [genuinely funny](http://bobdylan.com/moderntimes/songs/serve.html) - I know Dylan was in the middle of his Christian period, but that apparently didn't stop him from looking to get silly - it's also extremely apropos given our governor's demise.<!-- more -->

I'm sure that there's some absolutely hilarious joke that's just begging to be made about musicians, prostitutes and politicians, but I've never been good at making or remembering jokes, so I'll leave that to [other people](http://trippel.com/).

Anyway, the point of all this is that I still don't really have a comment about the whole Eliot Spitzer thing, but I'm at least entertaining some thoughts about it.
