The French believe
that trade follows the flag.

So do the English,
so do the Germans,
so do the Japanese,
so do the Italians.

Italy is in Ethopia
for the same reason
that the French
are in Algeria,
the English in India,
the Japanese in Manchuria.

The Italians say
thatthe Ethopians
are not civilized.

The last war proves
that Europeans
are no more civilized
than the Africans.

So Europeans
ought to find a way
to become civilized
before thinking
about the best way
to civilize Africans.
