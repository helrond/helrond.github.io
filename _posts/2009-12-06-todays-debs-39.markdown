Beware of the liveried hypocrites of the landlords, the usurers, the money-changers, the stock-gamblers, the exploiters, the enslavers and despoilers of the people; beware of the ruling class politicians and preachers and mercenary menials in every form who are so profoundly concerned about your "patriotism" and your "religion" and who receive their 30 pieces for warning you against socialism because it will endanger your morality and interfere with your salvation.
