Modern Society
believes in the separation
of Church and State.

But the Jews
did not believe in it.

The Greeks
did not believe in it.

The Romans
did not believe in it.

The Mediaevals
did not believe in it.

The Puritians
did not believe in it.

Modern society
has separated Church and State
but it did not separate the State
from business.

The State is no longer
a Church's State.

The State is now
a Business Men's State.
