[Theodore Roosevelt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt) used to say:
"If you want peace
prepare for war."

So everybody prepared for war
but war preparations
did not bring peace;
they brought war.

Since war preparations
brought war,
why not quit
preparing for war.

If nations preparing for peace
instead of preparing for war,
they might have peace.

[Aristide Briand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristide_Briand) used to say:
"The best kind of disarmament
is the disarmament of the heart."

The disarmament of Germany
by [the Allies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II)
was not the product
of a change of heart
on the part of the Allies
toward Germany.
