As [President Wilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson) said,
the World War
was a commercial war.

But a commercial war
had to be idealized,
so it was called
a War for Democracy.

But the War for Democracy
did not bring Democracy:
it brought
[Bolshevism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik) in Russia,
[Fascism in Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Fascism),
Nazism in Germany.
