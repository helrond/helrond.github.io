With the discovery of steam
the factory system
made its appearance.
  
To take drudgery out of the home
was suppose to be
the aim of the manufacturer.

So the guildsman
left his shop
and went to the factory.

But the profit-making manufacturer
found it more profitable
to employ women
than to employ men.

So the women left the home
and went to the factory.

Soon the children
followed the women
into the factory.

So the men have to stay at home
while women and children
work in the factory.
