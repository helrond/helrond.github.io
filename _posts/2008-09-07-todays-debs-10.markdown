title: Today's Debs
---

The workingman today does not understand his industrial relation  to his fellow-workers. He has never been correlated with others  in the same industry. He has mechanically done his part. He has  simply been a cog, with little reference to, or knowledge of,  the rest of the cogs. Now, we teach him to hold up his head and  look over the whole mechanism. If he is employed in a certain  plant, as an Industrial Unionist, his eyes are opened. He takes  a survey of the entire productive mechanism, and he understands  his part in it, and his relation to every other worker in that  industry. The very instant he does that he is buoyed by a fresh  hope and thrilled with a new aspiration. He becomes a larger  man. He begins to feel like a collective son of toil.<!-- more -->

In every mill and every factory, every mine and every quarry,  every railroad and every shop, everywhere, the workers,  enlightened, understanding their self-interest, are correlating  themselves in the industrial and economic mechanism. They are  developing their industrial consciousness, their economic and  political power; and when the revolution comes, they will be  prepared to take possession and assume control of every  industry. With the education they will have received in the  Industrial Workers they will be drilled and disciplined, trained  and fitted for Industrial Mastery and Social Freedom.
