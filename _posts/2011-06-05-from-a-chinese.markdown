title: From a Chinese

A Chinese says:
I thought I had become westernized
but now I am becoming repatriated.

The material progress of America
has dazzled me.

I wished while there
to transplant what I saw
to China.

But now that I am home again
I see that our two civilizations
have irreconcilable differences.

Yours is a machine civilization;
ours is a handicraft civilization.

Your people
work in factories;
our people
work in shops.

Your people
produce quality things
that are alike.

Our people
produce quality things
that are different.
