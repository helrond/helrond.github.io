I got the link to this [absolutely insane article](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/21/us/nationalspecial2/21cats.html?_r=1&ref=nyregion&oref=slogin) in the NY Times today from Nick, who can always be counted on to find the arcane and/or slightly unbelievable corners of the web, especially when they involve Republicans, the Yankees, or Catholicism.

Fast-forward a few hours, and Craig is cackling at something while he's processing a collection of Teamsters-related court cases.  No, it's not all the [wacky names](http://hungryghoast.tumblr.com/post/32444811) these guys had (because after all, if you want to be in the mob, you need a good handle), he's cracking up because this story made it to number two on the Times most-emailed list.

The whole thing is just so surreal.  As someone once said, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot man?
