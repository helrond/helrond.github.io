> When I showed up for rehearsal, my dad and stepmother, June, were there, sitting in the empty audience. I knew he was in Washington, planning to go to some of the festivities, but I didn't expect to see him at rehearsal for a show in which he wasn't even performing. I knew he had come partly to see me, and partly because he had a huge crush on Emmylou. Everyone knew about his crush on her, including June. It was adorable.
