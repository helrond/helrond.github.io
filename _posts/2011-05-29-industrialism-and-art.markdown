[Eric Gill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Gill) says:
the notion of work
has been separated
from the notion of art.

The notion of the useful
has been separated
from the notion of the beautiful.

The artist,
that is to say,
the responsible workman,
has been separated
from all other workmen.

The factory hand
has no responsibility
for what he produces.

He has been reduced
to a sub-human condition
of intellectual irresponsibility.

Industrialism
has released the artist
from the necessity
of making anything useful.

Industrialism
has also released the workman
from making anything amusing.
