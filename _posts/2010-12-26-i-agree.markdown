that the Communist criticism
of the [rugged individualism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism)
of bourgeois capitalism
is a sound criticism.

I agree with seven Bishops,
three of whom are Archbishops,

I agree with seven Bishops,
three whom are Archbishops,
that the Communists are not sound
when they advocate [class struggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_struggle)
and [proletarian dictatorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat)
as the best practical means
to realize their sound social aim.
