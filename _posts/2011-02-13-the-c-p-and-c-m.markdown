[The Communist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_party)
credits bourgeois capitalism
with an historic mission.

The Communitarian Movement
condemns it
on general principles.

The Communist Party
throws the [monkey-wrench](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_wrench)
of class struggle
into the economic machinery
and by doing so
delays the fulfilling
of the historic mission
which it credits
to capitalism.

The Communitarian Movement
aims to create
a new society
within the shell of the old
with the philosophy of the new
which is not
a new philosophy
but a very old philosophy,
a philosophy so old
that it looks like new.

The Communist Party
stands for [proletarian dictatorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat).

The Communitarian Movement
stands for [personalist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalism) leadership.
