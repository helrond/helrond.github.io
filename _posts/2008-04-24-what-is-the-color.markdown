So there's this ad on Scrabulous for a Kabal personality test which has the headline, "What does your soul look like?" I have to admit I don't know.

Maybe it's because it's karaoke night and I've been regaled by a parade of just absolutely atrocious renditions of the worst songs ever written (really people, it is necessary to try and do a karaoke version of Love Shack? Really? That's right, I didn't think so.) and so I am a little more bitter than usual, but all I can think right now is that I haven't been anywhere really quiet for a long, long time.  And I'm not just talking about noise and/or sound waves.<!-- more -->

The other day I was on Houston Street waiting for Josh, and for a few seconds there was no traffic, and I could hear a bird in a tree nearby, and I realized I really miss the smallness of those moments where you can grasp what's going on without being caffeinated out of your mind or on red-alert hyper mode, and all you have to do is be there. There's something really, really holy (yes, I know, forgive me) in them.

Right now I just want to be somewhere quiet.

Maybe that's my Earth Day post, two days late.
