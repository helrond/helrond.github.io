[Andrew Nelson Lytle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Nelson_Lytle) says:
The escape from industrialism
is not in socialism
or in sovietism.

The answer lies
in a return to a society
where agriculture is practised
by most of the people.

It is in fact impossible
for any culture
to be sound and healthy
without a proper regard
for the soil,
no matter
how many urban dwellers
think that their food
comes from groceries
and [delicatessens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicatessen)
or their milk from [tin cans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_can).

This ignorance
does not release them
from a final dependence
upon the farm.
