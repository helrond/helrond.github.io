I neglected to mention yesterday that I have friends who used to have a very large tabby cat, which they named Ratzinger because, as they said, it's the perfect name for a cat. Ratzinger, however, never seemed too interested in getting involved with rats; he was more into eating and sleeping.

I think it's been a number of years since he's passed along to the happy hunting grounds of feline bliss.

As usual, there's no point here, just sayin'...
