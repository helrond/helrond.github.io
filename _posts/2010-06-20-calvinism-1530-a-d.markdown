American Puritanism
was to a great extent
an outgrowth of Calvinism.

Andre' Siegfried says:
"The Puritan
is proud to be rich.

"If he makes money,
he likes to tell himself
that Divine Providence
sends it to him.

"His wealth itself
becomes in his eyes
as well as the eyes of others
a mark of God's blessing.

"A time comes
when he no longer knows
if he acts for duty's sake
or for interest's sake.

"It becomes difficult
in those conditions
to make a demarcation
between religious aspiration
and the pursuit of wealth."
