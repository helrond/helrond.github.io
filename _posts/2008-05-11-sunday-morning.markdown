Since it's Sunday, it seemed appropriate to post a link to [this article](http://drupal02.nypl.org/blogs/2008/05/05/church-craft) from [Jessica Pizga's blog](http://drupal02.nypl.org/blogs/jessica-pigza) that touches on the connection between creativity and spirituality:


> Lady A: Where are ---? Weren't they coming?
Lady B: They're at church. They'll come here after and meet us.
Lady A: Church? This IS my church!<!-- more -->

And Lady A has, indeed, hit upon a truth. Creative acts have a role in spirituality that goes far beyond singing in church choirs. Anyone who knows of the meditative nature of knitting, or the way that focusing one's physical and mental energies on a single creative process can bring calm, will perhaps agree with Lady A.


And while I'm at it, props to the NYPL for supporting so many [blogs](http://drupal02.nypl.org/), most of which are actually interesting and worth reading, mostly because they don't try to hard to be library-related.
