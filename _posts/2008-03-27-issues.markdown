The Dow Jones blog ran [this graphic](http://bp3.blogger.com/_0TmOt_IlVeA/R83J-lnWSaI/AAAAAAAAANY/jsy8S4I0rsE/s1600-h/Issue_Stacked_Bar.png) a while ago. While it is obviously outdated at this point, I still think it's interesting. The actual nuts and bolts of how they put this together are a little hazy, but I do like that it gives you a very quick read on each candidate's platform.

Also, in case you haven't seen it, here is an excellent video of a debate between Noam Chomsky and Robert F. Buckley in 1969. You know, back when they were both alive and people cared and stuff.
