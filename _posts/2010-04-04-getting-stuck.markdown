Ethical teachers seem to wish
every worker to be a stockholder
and every stockhoulder to be a worker.

As a stockholder
the worker wants bigger dividends.

As a worker
he wants bigger wages.

And the stock promoters
stock him with stocks
till he gets stuck.

And labor organizers
promise him better conditions
and exact bigger dues.

And the worker
finds himself exploited
both by stock promoters
and labor organizers.
