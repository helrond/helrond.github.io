Every once in a while, [I'm reminded of the genius of Bob Dylan](http://bobdylan.com/moderntimes/songs/tomthumb.html), and I also understand why the whole "voice of a generation" thing pissed him off so much.  He wasn't just after a generation, he was after something bigger.<!-- more -->

And sometimes I think he got it.
