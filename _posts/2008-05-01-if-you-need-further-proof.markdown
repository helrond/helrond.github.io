...that punk is dead, consider this it.

I know I am [way behind the 8-ball](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/19/arts/music/19varv.html?ex=1366344000&en=d3ce38d71011ac93&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink) on this one, but I totally intended to write about this a few weeks ago when I walked by the former site of CBGBs and saw this freaking monstrosity in its place.<!-- more -->

Whoever took over this space was going to have to deal with some serious demons, but John Varvatos?  Really?  I don't really have a problem with Varvatos, other than that stupid ad campaign with Ric Ocasek looking like a total douche (or Jack Nicholson, which ever is worse), but it just seems like a stupid move on their part.  You can almost see the meeting in which this was discussed:

"So, CBGBs just got shut down and the space is available.  I say we snap it up and use it as our flagship store"

"Great idea!  That way we can contribute to the ongoing project of turning New York City into a mecca for midwestern tourists."

I should also mention that right around the corner, on the ground floor of a sparkling new condo building, is a place called "The Bowery Wine Company" that looks like it bought its decor from a TGI Fridays going-out-of-business sale. [I am not making this up](http://www.bowerywineco.com/).  Even I am not that twisted.

Why do I suddenly feel like I'm in Cincinnati?
