Owen Young says:
"We will never have prosperity
as long as
there is no balance
between industry
and agriculture."

The farmer sells
in an open market
and is forced to buy
in a restricted market.

When the farmer gets
a pair of overalls
for a bushel of wheat
the wheat and the overalls
are on the level.

When the farmer
has to give
two bushels of wheat
for a pair of overalls
the wheat and the overalls
are not on the level.

Wheat and overalls
must be on the level.
