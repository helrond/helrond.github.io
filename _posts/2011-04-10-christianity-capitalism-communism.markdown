Christianity has nothing to do
with either modern Capitalism
or modern Communism,
for Christianity
has a Capitalism of its own,
and a Communism of its own.

Modern Capitalism
is based on property
without responsibility,
while Christian Capitalism
is based on property
with responsibility.

Modern Communism
is based on poverty through force,
while Christian Communism
is based on poverty through choice.

For a Christian,
voluntary poverty is the ideal
as exemplified by Saint Francis of Assisi,
while privte property
is not an absolute right,
but a trust,
which must be administered
for the benefit of God's children.
