[Ralph Adams Cram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Adams_Cram) says:
What I propose
is that Catholics
should take up
this back-to-the-land problem
and put it into operation.

Why Catholics?
Because they realize
more clearly than any others
the shortcomings
of the old capitalist
industrial system.

They, better than others,
see the threat
that impends.

They alone understand
that while the family
is the primary social unit,
the community comes next.

And there is
no sound
and righteous
and enduring community
where all its members
are not substantially
of one mind.
