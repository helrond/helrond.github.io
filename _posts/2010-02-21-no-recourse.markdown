Politicians used to say:
"We make prosperity
through our wise policies."

Business men used to say:
"We make prosperity
through our private enterprise."

The workers did not have anything to say
about the matter;

They were either put to work
or thrown out of employment

And when unemployment came
the workers
had no recourse
against the professed makers
of prosperity,
politicians and business men.
