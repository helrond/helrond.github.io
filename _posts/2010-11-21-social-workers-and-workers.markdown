to adjust themselves

does not enable them

Social workers
must become social minded
before they can be
critics of the existing environment
and free creative agents
of the new environment.

and the social-mindedness
or understanding of social forces
which will make them
critical of the existing environment
and free creative agents
of a new environment.
