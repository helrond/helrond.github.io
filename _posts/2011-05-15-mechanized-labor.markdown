Gandhi says:
"Industrialism is evil."

Industrialism is evil
because it brings idleness
both to the capitalist class
and the working class.

Idleness does no good
either to the capitalist class
or the working class.

Creative labor
is what keeps people
out of mischief.

Creative labor
is craft labor.

Mechanized labor
is not creative labor.
