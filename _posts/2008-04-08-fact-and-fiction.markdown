I'd like to think it has less to do with my gullibility than the ever-increasing possibilities for the most unbelievable crap to happen.  I mean, really, when we have an administration in office who blatantly lied (connection to Al Quaeda - no; weapons of mass destruction - no; Osama Bin Laden - no; spreading democracy - do I really need to go there?) to get us into a war that's completely ruined the economy and massacred every shred of credibility this country has had and there seem to be absolutely no consequences for this, then Hannah Montana being a genius isn't so implausible.
