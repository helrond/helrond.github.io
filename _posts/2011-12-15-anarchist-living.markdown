title: Anarchist living
---

For anarchism today, reality is to be found in a diversity of activity we have outlined previously; anarchist living can adapt itself to a multiplicity of forms, beginning with the revolutionary demands of anarchosyndicalism and concluding with the libertarian presence in urban neighborhoods, in universities, in teaching.... The libertarian presence in neighborhoods must learn how to introduce practical activities leading to self-management. The citizen living in a particular neighborhood tries to understand the problems of that neighborhoodand what to do about them. This is the first step toward achieving a community that is controlled by the citizens who live there, rather than by leaders. This is democracy raised to its highest level. This is government of the people by the people.

from Anarchist Organisation: The History of the F.A.I. by Juan Gomez Casas.
