title: Wealth-Producing Maniacs

When John Calvin
legalized money-lending at interest,
he made the bank account
the standard of values.

When the bank account
became the standard of values,
people ceased to produce for use
and began to produce for profits.

When people began to produce for profits
they became
wealth-producing maniacs.

When people became wealth-producing maniacs
they produced too much wealth.

When people found out
that they had produced too much wealth
they went on an orgy
of wealth-destruction
and destroyed
ten million lives besides.
