[![]({{ rooturl }}/img/blog/2009/02/0228091753a.jpg)]({{ rooturl }}/img/blog/2009/02/0228091753a.jpg)Just back from an exhausting and exhilarating day at [DrupalCampNYC6](http://groups.drupal.org/node/18467). Met a lot of great new people, and hung with a few [current](http://matienzo.org/) and old acquaintances as well. My brain hurts from trying to wrap it around Views, Panels, Nodes, and PHP, but it's a good tired.<!-- more -->

While, there, I ran into my friend Phil Buehler, who just recently "edited" [_All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy_](http://www.blurb.com/books/512660) by [Jack Torrance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Torrance). Apparently it's been relatively successful, giving him a nice return on a relatively minimal investment. Graspable concept plus cheap access to distribution and production equals greater creativity.

Anyway, stay tuned for more developments from my pending Drupal projects. Structured data, here I come!
