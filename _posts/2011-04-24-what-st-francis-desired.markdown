According to Johannes Jorgensen, a Danish convert, living in Assisi:
[Saint Francis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_of_Assisi) desired
that men should give up
superfluous possessions.
Saint Francis desired
that men should work
with their hands.
Saint Francis desired
that men should offer their services
as a gift.
Saint Francis desired
that men should ask other people for help
when work failed them.
Saint Francis desired
that men should live
as free as birds.
Saint Francis desired
that men should go through life
giving thanks to God
for His gifts.
