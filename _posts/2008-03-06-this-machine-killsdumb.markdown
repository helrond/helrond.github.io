So, I'm one of those people who's had a Hotmail account for about ten years now, so at this point it's purely a spam- and listserv-catcher.  I happened to notice, in one of the banner ads which appeared the other day, a photo of a guy with a guitar that looked eerily familiar.  I clicked on it, and got this [stupid video](http://video.msn.com/video.aspx?mkt=en-us&vid=2b08f236-ff76-4137-ab5e-967fd9554f0e).<!-- more -->

I don't know how obvious I need to be, but...um, well, just look at [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Woody_Guthrie.jpg/646px-Woody_Guthrie.jpg) and I think you'll get the point.

I'm not sure what to make of this; on the one hand it's great that Woody Guthrie has pervaded popular culture to this extent.  On the other hand that video is probably one of the stupidest things I've seen in a very long time, and it seems kind of ridiculous to take one of the most outrageous political statements in recent American history and use it to sell a search engine, and a crappy one at that...
