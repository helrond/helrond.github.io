Every once in a while the New York Times gets it right, like when they hand over the reins to someone with something interesting to say.  I was just clued into this blog today (thanks Josh), and started reading back into the entries and came across [Roseanne Cash's post](http://measureformeasure.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/well-actually-it-is-brain-surgery/) from April 5th, which contained these two gems of paragraphs:<!-- more -->

That is my own projection, I'm sure, but I thought of something a friend used to say about that particular brand of religion "” that it was like "looking at the ground with a flashlight when the whole universe was around you waiting to be noticed." Walking to the beach later, I was thinking about how my own idea of God was so mutable, and that even though I pray, most of the time I haven't a clue to whom I'm praying.

And I like it that way. Sometimes God is Art, Music and Children and that is more than good enough. Ruminating on these things, I thought of a phrase "” "the pantheon of my religious desires" "” and I wrote it in my notebook. That line is probably too sophomore-English-major precious, but this is how songs begin for me. Sometimes.


Yes.  Just yes.
