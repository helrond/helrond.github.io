The order of the day
is to talk about the social order.

Conservatives would like
to keep it from changing
but they don't know how.

Liberals try to patch it
and call it a New Deal.

Socialists want a change,
but a gradual change.

Communists want a change,
an immediate change,
but a Socialist change.

Communists in Russia
do not build Communism,
they build Socialism.

Communists want to pass
from capitalism to Socialism
and from Socialism to Communism.

I want a change,
and a radical change.

I want a change
from an acquisitive society
to a functional society,
from a society of go-getters
to a society of go-givers.
