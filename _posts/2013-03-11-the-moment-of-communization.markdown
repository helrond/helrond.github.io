For us, communization does not signify some general positive process of 'sharing' or 'making commoning'. It signifies the specific revolutionary undoing of the relations of property constitutive of the capitalist class relation. Sharing as such - if this has any meaning at all - can hardly be understood as involving this undoing of capitalist relations, for various kinds of 'sharing' or 'making common' can easily be shown to play important roles withing capitalist society without in any way impeding capitalist accumulation. Indeed, they are often essential to - or even constitutive in - that accumulation: consumption goods shared within families, risk shared via insurance, resources shared within firms, scientific knowledge shared through academic publications, standards and protocols sharked between rival capitals because they are recognized as being in their common interest. In such cases, without contradiction, what is held in common is the counterpart to an appropriation. As such, a dynamic of communization would involve the undoing of such forms of 'sharing', just as it would involve the undoing of private appropriation.
