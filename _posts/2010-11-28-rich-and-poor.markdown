Afraid of the poor
who don't like to get poorer,
the rich who like to get richer
turn to the State for protection.

But the State is not only
the State of the rich
it is also the State of the poor
who don't like to get poorer.

So the State sometimes chooses to help
the many poor
who don't like to get poorer,
at the expense of the few rich
who like to get richer.

Dissatisfied with the State,
the rich who like to get richer
turn to the Church
to save them from the poor
who don't like to get poorer.

But the Church can only tell the rich
who like to get richer:
"Woe to you rich
who like to get richer,
if you don't help the poor
who don't like to get poorer."
