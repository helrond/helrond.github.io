Based on the evidence supplied in the photo below, Orson Welles has

(a) had one too many highballs.
(b) just snorted a mountain of cocaine with Charlton Heston.
(c) realized that Citizen Kane was the highlight of his cinematic career and that he is now a puffy actor/director for whom the rest of his life will be a long downhill slide.
(d) been practicing for the lead role in his next movie, the life of Jesus Christ.
(e) decided that he is bored out of his mind by the conversation and faking an epileptic seizure to get out of it.
