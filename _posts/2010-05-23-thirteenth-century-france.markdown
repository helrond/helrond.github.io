Henry Adams, who had in his ancestry
two Presidents of the United States,
says in his autobiography
that one cannot get an education
in modern America.

And the reason he gives is,
that there is
no unity of thought
in modern America.

So he went to England
and found that modern England
is too much like America.

So he went to France
and found that modern France
is too much like England and America.

But in France, Henry Adams found
that one could get an education
in thirteenth-century France.

And he wrote a book concerning
the Cathedral of Chartes
and the Mount Saint-Michel,
where he points out
that there was unity of thought
in thirteenth-century France.
