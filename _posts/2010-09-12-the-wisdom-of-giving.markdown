To give to the poor
is to enable the poor to buy.

To enable the poor to buy
is to improve the market.

To improve the market
is to help [business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business).

To help business
is to reduce [unemployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment).

To reduce unemployment
is to reduce crime.

To reduce crime
is to reduce [taxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax).

So why not give to the poor
for business' sake,
for humanity's sake,
for [God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God)'s sake?
