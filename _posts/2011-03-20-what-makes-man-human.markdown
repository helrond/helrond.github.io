To give and not to take
that is what makes man human.
To serve and not to rule
that is what makes man human.
To help and not to crush
that is what makes man human.
To nourish and not to devour
that is what makes man human.
And if need be
to die and not to live
that is what makes man human.
Ideals and not deals
that is what makes man human.
Creed and not greed
that is what makes man human.
