Every once in a while, you come across a song that perfectly describes not only how you feel, the world around you and the people you know, but describes _you _better than if you'd written it yourself.  Smells Like Teen Spirit, Won't Get Fooled Again, Like A Rolling Stone, Purple Haze...the list goes on.<!-- more -->

Sometimes it's a novel, a short story, a poem, or even just a line in one of those things that does it.

Today, it was an amazing piece of art that did it for me. This is [my life](http://seriouslythough.tumblr.com/post/34820705).

Thankyou, [Dr. Hungryhoast](http://hungryghoast.tumblr.com/).
