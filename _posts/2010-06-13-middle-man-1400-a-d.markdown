Around 1400 A.D.
appears the middle-man.

He offers to buy the goods
and to find a market.

The guild's man
thinks about the money
offered for his goods
and forgets the Common Good.

And the middle-man
is not interested
in selling useful goods
but in making money
on any kind of goods.

And the consumer 
never meets the producer
and the producer
ceases to think
in terms of service
and begins to think
in terms of profits.
